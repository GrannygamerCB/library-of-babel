			<p>We also know of another <span id="superstition" class="italics">superstition</span></span> of that time: that of the <span id="commentA" class="circle">Man of the Book.</span> One some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) <span id="commentB" class="underline">there must exist a book which the formula and perfect <span id="compendium" class="italics">compendium</span> of all the rest:</span> some librarian has gone through it and he is <span id="commentC" class="underline"><span id="analogous" class="italics">analogous</span> to a god.</span> In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary’s cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the <span id="venerated" class="italics">venerated</span> secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: <span class="highlight">To locate book A, consult first book B which indicated A’s position; to locate book B, consult first book C, and so on to infinity…</span> In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted by years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe[3]; I pray to the unknown gods that a man -- just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! -- may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. <span id="commentD" class="underline">Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified.</span> The <span id="impious" class="italics">impious</span> maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the ‘feverish Library whose chance volumes are <span id="commentE" class="underline">constantly in danger of changing</span> into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity.’ These words, which may not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their author’s abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, <span class="highlight">the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense.</span> It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled <span id="commentF" class="underline"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Combed Thunderclap</span> and another <span style="font-style: italic;">The Plaster Cramp</span> and another <span style="font-style: italic;">Axaxaxas mlö.</span></span> These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or <span id="allegorical" class="italics">allegorical</span> manner; such a justification is verbal and, <span style="font-style: italic;">ex hypothesi,</span> already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some character</p>

			<p><span style="font-style: italic;">dhcmrlchtdj</span></p>

			<p>which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into <span id="tautology" class="italics">tautology.</span> This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons -- and its refutation as well. (An <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol library allows the correct definition a <span id="ubiquitous" class="italics">ubiquitous</span> and lasting system of hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. <span class="highlight">You who read me, as You sure of understanding my language?)</span></p>
