			<p>When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. <span class="highlight">There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon.</span> <span id="commentA" class="underline">The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope.</span> At that time a great deal was said about the <span id="vindications" class="italics">Vindications:</span> books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained <span id="prodigious" class="italics">prodigious</span> <span id="arcana" class="italics">arcana</span> for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, <span id="commentB" class="underline">strangled each other on the divine stairways,</span> flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad… The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that <span id="commentC" class="underline">the possibility of a man’s finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.</span></p>
