			<P>At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity’s basic mysteries -- the origin of the Library and of time -- might be found It is <span id="verisimilar" class="italics">verisimilar</span> that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: <span class="highlight">if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars.</span> For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons… There are official searchers, <span id="commentA" class="circle">inquisitors.</span> I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys;they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they walk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. <span id="commentB" class="underline">Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.</span></P>
