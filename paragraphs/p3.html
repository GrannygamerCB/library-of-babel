			<p>Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the <span class="highlight">catalogue of catalogues;</span> now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, <span id="commentA" class="underline">I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.</span> Once I am dead, there will be <span id="commentB" class="underline">no lack of <span id="pious" class="italics">pious</span> hands to throw me over the railing;</span> my grave will be the <span id="fathomless" class="italics">fathomless</span> air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. <span class="highlight">I say that the Library is unending.</span> The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: <span class="highlight">The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.</span></p>
