			<p>Second: The <span id="orthographical" class="italics">orthographical</span> symbols are twenty-five in number[1]. This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: <span class="highlight">the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books.</span> One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere <span id="labyrinth" class="italics">labyrinth</span> of letters, but the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: <span id="commentA" class="underline">for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless <span id="cacophonies" class="italics">cacophonies,</span> verbal jumbles and incoherences.</span> (I know of an <span id="uncouth" class="italics">uncouth</span> region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s palm… They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely <span id="fallacious" class="italics">fallacious</span>.)</p>
