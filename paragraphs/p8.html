			<p>Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon[2] came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which nearly two pages of homogenous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were <span id="yiddish" class="italics">Yiddish.</span> Within a century, the language was established: a <span id="samoyedic" class="italics">Samoyedic</span> Lithuanian dialect of <span id="guarani" class="italics">Guarani,</span> with classical Arabian infections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. <span class="highlight">This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.</span> He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: <span class="underline">In the vast Library there are no two identical books.</span> From these two <span id="incontrovertible" class="italics">incontrovertible</span> premises he deduced that <span id="commentA" class="underline">the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols</span> (a number which, though extremely vast, it not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels’ autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the <span id="gnostic" class="italics">Gnostic</span> <span id="gospel" class="italics">gospel</span> of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the <span id="commentB" class="underline"><span id="interpolations" class="italics">interpolations</span> of every book in all books.</span></p>
